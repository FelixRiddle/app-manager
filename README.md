# Good roots app manager

This one and general frontend have to be fixed port(for now).

App manager port: 24000

# Fixed file system hierarchy

This project assumes that there's a fixed hierarchy of projects / repositories.

This fixed hierarchy is like this:

home/Repositories is the main folder

```bash
~/Repositories
```

Javascript repositories have to be located at:

```bash
~/Repositories/Javascript
```



# Environment variables

```bash
# MySQL database
MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME=
MYSQL_USERNAME=
MYSQL_PASSWORD=
MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_PORT=3306
```
